    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      We are a student-led organization based in the University of
      Wisconsin-Madison that provides a peer to peer support platform for
      Malaysian students in the US. We believe that there is a lack of support
      system for the students abroad, especially in regards to mental health
      concerns. Through our communication features, we are providing ways for
      students to speak up and share their concerns, just like having a friend
      who listen to your stories. Our team consists of inspiring individuals who
      always care for others and dedicated to change the stigma against mental
      health.
    </p>
    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>
      Provide a platform for individuals to express themselves freely regarding
      mental health.
    </p>
    <h1>Our Vision</h1>
    <p>
      Provide an environment where individuals can discuss comfortably about
      mental health.
